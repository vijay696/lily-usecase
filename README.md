Hi,
My name is Vijay G R
I'm FrontEnd Developer/Full stack Developer

About me:

I'm an enthusiastic, keen and passionate developer. I constantly work to develop my core skills and learn about new technologies. I work primarily on Web Development.


I have over 7 years of experience in the field of web development. Although I began my career as a Full Stack developer, I soon discovered my true passion lies in Front-End development. My interest and focus gradually shifted towards this aspect of web development. I have extensive experience with various frameworks and libraries, including JavaScript and AngularJS. However, I firmly believe that having a strong grasp of the fundamentals of JavaScript is essential, as it serves as the foundation for all other technologies.


In the ever-evolving IT industry, new frameworks and technologies continually emerge. I am always eager to adapt and learn, as change is a constant in our field. I am open to acquiring new skills and knowledge to contribute effectively to any tech stack required for a project. I take pride in my strong work ethic and strive to excel in every task I undertake, combining both hard work and smart thinking to deliver the best results.
